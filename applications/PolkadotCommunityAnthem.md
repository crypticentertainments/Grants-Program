### Ecosystem Fit

Cryptocurrency and Blockchain space has been gaining popularity in recent times and is witnessing a remarkable expansion in its user base. However, even with its growing reach, there remains a gap between the kind of public awareness that exists, and the kind that may ideally be needed to ensure deeper and wider penetration of cryptocurrency and Blockchain space in general, and Polkadot in particular. For the masses to appreciate the kind of powerful tech and solution that Polkadot offers, they need to understand both the benefits and the challenges of being a cryptocurrency user. What we need is a conversation starter, and it has been proven time and again, that nothing starts a conversation like music. To make people sit up and take notice, we first need to capture their attention in the simplest way possible. A well-composed, targeted jingle/original theme song is the easiest way to achieve this objective. Brands worldwide have been relying on impactful jingles to create a lasting and memorable brand, and generate the much-needed buzz and curiosity around their offerings.

We will be creating a community anthem for Polkadot which will be a key piece for expanding the community and reaching to a wider set of people.
